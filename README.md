# MyToken Solidity Contract

## Overview

MyToken is a simple Solidity contract for creating and managing a basic token on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract includes functionalities for minting and burning tokens, maintaining balances, and tracking the total supply.

## Contract Details

### Public Variables
- `tokenName`: The name of the token.
- `tokenAbbrv`: The abbreviation of the token name.
- `totalSupply`: The total number of tokens in existence.

### Mappings
- `balances`: A mapping that stores the balance of each address.

### Functions
- `mint`: Increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address.
- `burn`: Decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, ensuring that the balance is sufficient for the burn operation.

    REQUIREMENTS:
    1. The contract will have public variables that store the details about the coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply).
    2. The contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint256).
    3. The mint function increases the total supply by a specified number and increases the balance of a specified address by that amount.
    4. The burn function decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, ensuring that the balance is sufficient for the burn operation.

Usage
Deploying the Contract
Use an Ethereum development environment like Remix to compile and deploy the contract to an Ethereum network.
Interact with the deployed contract using its address on the Ethereum network.
Interacting with the Contract
You can interact with the deployed contract using Ethereum wallets or by writing scripts in programming languages like JavaScript. Here's how you can interact with the contract:

Minting Tokens
Call the mint function with the address where you want to send the tokens and the amount to mint.

Burning Tokens
Call the burn function with the address from where you want to burn the tokens and the amount to burn.

How to Run the Program in Remix
Compile the Smart Contract
Select the Solidity Compiler tab.
Ensure the compiler version is set to 0.8.18.
Click Compile MyToken.sol.
Deploy the Contract
Go to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
Select the appropriate environment (e.g., JavaScript VM).
Click Deploy.
Interact with the Contract
After deploying, the contract will appear under Deployed Contracts.

To mint tokens:

Input the address and the amount of tokens to mint.
Click the mint button.
To burn tokens:

Input the address and the amount of tokens to burn.
Click the burn button.
